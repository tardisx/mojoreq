Single file mojolicious based request tracker.

* I wanted to track my project bugs / features.
* I wanted to keep my own data on my own machine.
* I wanted something that was perl, and minimalistic.
 
There wasn't anything, so I wrote this.

Features:

* Basic request tracking
* Products and Categories for requests
* Basic web interface
* Really really fast :-)
* Did I mention it's minimalistic?

As I redefine the boundaries of 'essential' and 'minimalistic', the 
feature list will grow.

Installing (this will be easier in future):

# make a directory for the thing
$ mkdir mojoreq

# grab the source:
$ wget https://github.com/tardisx/mojoreq/raw/master/mojoreq.pl > mojoreq.pl

# setup the db
$ sqlite3 mojoreq.db
# now paste the database schema from the mojoreq.pl

# run it
$ ./mojoreq.pl daemon --listen http://\*:3000

# use it
# open your web browser to http://localhost:3000
