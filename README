Single file mojolicious based request tracker.

* I wanted to track my project bugs / features.
* I wanted to keep my own data on my own machine.
* I wanted something that was perl, and minimalistic.
 
There wasn't anything, so I wrote this.

Features:

* Basic request tracking
* Products and Categories for requests
* Basic web interface
* Really really fast :-)
* Did I mention it's minimalistic?

As I redefine the boundaries of 'essential' and 'minimalistic', the 
feature list will grow.
